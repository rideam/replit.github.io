# Team Nicknames

You can give your team members nicknames in Replit Teams to help better organize and view your teammates. 

Nicknames enable you to:

- Easily identify students using a name they are known by, without sacrificing any privacy. Nicknames are visible all over Teams for Education, so you'll be able to spot students at-a-glance in "Who's Coding", when assigning group projects, and in your Team Overview. 
- View and search by nickname in project submissions!
- Organize students into multiple cohorts or sections, by indicating each student's section in their nickname, then searching through submissions by section.
